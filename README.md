# thermocouple_amplifier
Thermocouple amplifier circuit(s) for interfacing with microcontrollers. 

1. J and K type thermocouple amplifier circuit built around LTC2053 instrumentation amplifier and LT1025 cold junction compensator.
   This breakout board has analog output of X mV/degC (yet to be tested). Initially feeding it to the ADC chhanel of an arduino UNO.
